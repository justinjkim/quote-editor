# Read about fixtures at https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

# Devise stores the `encrypted_password` field in the `users` table for
# security reasons. If we want our fixtures to have the string "password"
# as the actual password, we need to use the same method the Devise gem
# would use to encrypt the password in our fixtures, hence the need to
# use Devise::Encryptor.digest
