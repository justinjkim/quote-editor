# README

I created this Rails 7 app in the hopes of familiarizing myself with Hotwire, as I am
very interested in creating interactive and seamless pages without having to use
too much client-side Javascript. If the server is capable of not only housing the
logic but also rendering the HTML, then why not use an interactive tool like Hotwire?

I am using the excellent hotrails.dev tutorial to build a simple quote editor.
My hope is to also incorporate making calls to OpenAI's chatGPT service. While I 
don't think my app is breaking any new ground by doing this (because it's essentially
just making an API call), I think it's still good practice to explore what it's like
to utilize the growing AI technology.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
